# Music Antiquing

**Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/github/cwru-commlab/music-antiquing/blob/main/src/Music%20Antiquing.ipynb**

## ðŸ“¡ Assignment requirements
 - [X] Open the Jupyter notebook.
 - [ ] Upload a .wav file of your choice.
 - [ ] Run the sample code for your .wav file.
 - [ ] Listen to the recordings. Repeat this process for AM and FM broadcast bands by changing the values for F1 and F2. 
 - [ ] Change the code below to filter the .WAV file to a gramophone frequency range. (Also, you'll want to change the code that generates the filename to read "gramophone" instead of "telephone."
 - [ ] Download and save a local copy of your gramophone recording. You'll need it for the next exercise.
 - [ ] Upload your "gramophone" recording here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ICqKKwbJoknCo_0zhtQuk7iVmR31PHFxYuB6FlPYazU/edit
 - [ ] Optional: Save a local copy of the Jupyter notebook itself. (In Binder or Google Colab, your changes and created files will not be saved.)
 - [ ] Under "File" hit "Save and Export Notebook As" and save your file as a PDF.
 - [ ] Print the PDF and staple it to HW1.
 - [ ] On the printed copy, highlight the changes you made to the code.
 - [ ] Annotate the plots. How did the signal change? Does the bandwidth matter? If the signal is going to be bandlimited, do you prefer extending the bass or the treble? Why?

## Description
Over the course of the semester, we'll use Python to add effects to a sound clip to make it sound like it's playing on a gramophone. Here's where the goalposts are: https://youtu.be/QbsXLDNPvNc?t=28
